IKEA Grundtal is quite cool to use. So we own one as well.
The only Thing that I was still concerned about was These small glasses of spice that are around and needed to be placed on the Ground of the kitchen workbench.

So, in order to utilize the full workbench better, I decided to watch out for some hanging solution for the spices. Since Grundtal was available and some hooks anyway Need some space in between, I did test to use discontinual Elements as a storage for the spices and having the hooks in between.

Ikea also has a Approach for spices to hang on the grundtal bar, however, this is consuming a lot of allocation from the bar it self. So less Tools could be attached to it.

This Thing follows the YouGo3D 5S Household Approach :-)
