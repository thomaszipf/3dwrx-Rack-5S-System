# 3dwrx-Rack-5S-System

## The purpose of 3dwrx-Rack-5S-System
The inspiration behind this is classical organisational and improvement change. The product I have owned is IKEA Grundtal which is quite cool to use, the thing that I have found not good enough were these small glasses of spices that need to be placed on the ground of the kitchen workbench.
In order to use the most of the workbench, I designed this hanging solution for the spices.
Since Grundtal was available for me, I did test to use discontinual elemets as a storage for the spices and I had placed the hooks in between. IKEA also has approach how to organize your spices hanging on the grundtal bar, but however this is consuming a lot of allocation from the bar itself. So less tools could be attached to it.
